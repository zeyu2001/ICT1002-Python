Read data from an external data source, e.g. txt, Json, excel or other formats.
* Allow users to view datasets.
* Allow users to search the data based on some criterion
* Allow users to see some statistical information based on the data.

* Allow users to export results (per their choice)
* Advanced features
  * Identify our only way for pattern/anomaly detection, prediction or other analysis using advanced data science libraries like machine learning libraries

# Main Idea

Utilizing Covid-19 Dataset, and adding on with Machine Learning.

# To-do/Considerations

*To use Pandas to process excel file and Plotly Dash to make the web app.*
* Read datafile, clean data (Since there are many null areas that we need to fill with zeros)
* Choose Visualizations and implement
* Convert to web dashboard using dash
